# Regex Tutorial

Programming is a medium of creation that requires a lot of fine tuning within detail. There are plenty of times withing an application the program needs to be aware of certain combinations of letters, numbers, characters, and more. When it comes to words a developer doesn't want users to be able to use, to the requirements in passwords when making an account, developers don't have the time or code to spare to list out every possibly string of characters that the application can or can't accept. Regular Expressions, or Regex, is what saves so many developers time and effort in being able to have their applications be able to identify patterns in strings that need to be targeted for one reason or another.
